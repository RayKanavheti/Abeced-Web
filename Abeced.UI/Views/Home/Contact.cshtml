You are invited to use the ABECED SYSTEM free of charge for the next two weeks. 
The facts and information in ABECED have been supplied free of charge by your fellow Aberceders. If you wish to continue using the system after the two week trial you are asked to upload 100 facts/ pieces of information – more are welcome and appreciated. A one year period is given to upload the 100 facts and there after you will have free access to ABECED for the rest of your life. Make a list of facts you are currently studying (or would like to study) and get others in your group to do the same and soon all the information you would like to cover will be on ABECED.

Work is in progress to reward those who submit more than 100 facts or introduce who introduce others to ABECED.
